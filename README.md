## :computer: Project

<b>Shop Redux</b> it's a pratice project that I decided to do as a way of improve my knowledge with react and redux but mostly to learn redux-saga, technology that I never worked before.

## :books: Conclusion

At the beginning of that project was confusing to understand why should I use redux sagas with all of the boilerplate involved, but now I understand that is good to use sagas as a way to separate some logic from reducers making the code cleaner or when is require some kinds of stuff between actions and reducers working as a middleware.

In the process of development i also had the opportunity to meet and work with some new libraries with names json-server, react-toastify, immer and react-responsive. Also I learned about store subscription in redux that I used to save cart state in the local storage of the client.
